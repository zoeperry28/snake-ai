# snake-ai
A basic ai which can control and play a  game of snake

I will start by creating my own version of snake, then after impement my AI. 
I will be using OpenGL for graphics. Contained in the files is 'test.c', which shows an example of creating graphics pixel by pixel by 
using the functions from OpenGL. 

For ease of development, this will only have confirmed compatibility with linux based systems for now.
